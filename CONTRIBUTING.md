### Contributing
It's pretty simple really, simply fork the repo, make a fix, and submit a pull request with a fair amount of detail. Due to the sensitivity of such a project, PR's may take some time to be accepted in order to perform a thorough inspection. To increase the chance of getting approved, follow this list:
* Make useful changes. This early into development, I am willing to inspect small changes, but going into the future please ensure changes are of use to the project (no spam).
* Provide lots of detail in a pull request. This is a big one. If I don't know what you are trying to fix, I might see it as spam, so please describe what your change intends to do.
* Don't be scared of doing something wrong! We all have to start somewhere, and with Hacktoberfest right around the corner, I would be more than happy to see some beginners contribute. That's the beauty of open-source, anyone of any skill level can contribute. I check all PR before I release them to the wild, so if I see something unusual, I will provide feedback.
* Remember this repo is for creating a more secure version of nginx. 
* Follow the code of conduct at all times. It's not much to ask, just be civil, remember the human.
